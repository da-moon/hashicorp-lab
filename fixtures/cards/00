In this screencast, I will demonstrate how to use this repo.
Generally, working with this is pretty straightforward. 
All you need to do is type 'vagrant up' and you are good to go.

Some Pointers:
- Install Vagrant through package manager;
  i.e 'pacman' or 'apt' . Downloading vagrant binary and running 
  it directly can cause unexpected behavior on certain Linux 
  distributions since Vagrant binary is not statically link but rather an AppImage.
- There are two available providers: Virtualbox and Docker. 
  In case you are using 'virtualbox' provider, 
  make sure that your CPU supports nested virtualization; 
  i.e., you won't be able to use the VirtualBox provider on an AWS EC2 instance.
